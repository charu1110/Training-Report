### ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ 24 June 2025  
**Topic:** Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a beginner-friendly, high-level language widely used in AI, data science, automation, and web development. On Day 1, I focused on basic syntax and logic building using simple programs.

#### ðŸ”¹ Work Done:
- Practiced variable declaration and data types
- Used `input()` and `print()` for interactive programs
- Implemented basic arithmetic operations and conditionals

#### âœ… Programs Implemented:
- Calculate Sum and Difference of two numbers  
- Compute Simple Interest and Total Amount  
- Calculate Gross Salary, Tax, and Net Salary based on conditions

#### ðŸ§  Learnings:
- Understood how Python handles input/output
- Applied logic using `if-else` statements
- Built confidence writing simple, real-life calculation programs

#### ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:
- Output screenshots are saved in this folder along with the code

### ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ 25 June 2025  
**Topic:** Pandas Library and Python Loops

Pandas is a powerful Python library for working with datasets. I also revised and practiced loops in Python using real-world tasks.

#### ðŸ”¹ Work Done:
- Used Pandas to read, analyze, and describe CSV data
- Learned how to use DataFrames and Series in Colab
- Practiced `for` and `while` loops with conditions

#### âœ… Programs Implemented:
- Loaded and analyzed sample datasets using Pandas  
- Created a dynamic Grocery List program using a `while` loop

#### ðŸ§  Learnings:
- Learned how to manipulate and summarize data using Pandas
- Understood the role of loops in dynamic input-based programs
- Gained clarity on breaking and controlling infinite loops

#### ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:
- Colab outputs and terminal screenshots saved with todayâ€™s code

### ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ 26 June 2025  
**Topic:** Working with Excel and CSV Files in Google Colab

Today, I explored how to handle Excel and CSV files in Google Colab for data analysis. I learned to upload files directly into Colab and perform various operations using Pandas.

#### ðŸ”¹ Work Done:
- Learned how to upload Excel and CSV files into Colab
- Used `files.upload()` from `google.colab` to bring files into the environment
- Read Excel files using Pandas with `read_excel()` and CSV files using `read_csv()`
- Explored operations like:
  - Viewing data using `df.head()`
  - Checking columns and data types
  - Filtering rows based on conditions
  - Saving modified data back to CSV or Excel formats
- Practiced downloading processed files from Colab to the local machine

#### âœ… Programs Implemented:
- Uploaded an Excel file and converted it to CSV  
- Loaded CSV data into Pandas DataFrame  
- Filtered and summarized data based on conditions  
- Saved DataFrame back into CSV for download

#### ðŸ§  Learnings:
- Understood differences between Excel (.xlsx) and CSV (.csv) formats
- Gained practical skills in handling external data sources in Colab
- Built confidence in reading, manipulating, and saving datasets in different formats

#### ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:
- Colab notebook screenshots demonstrating file upload, reading, and data processing are saved in todayâ€™s folder
